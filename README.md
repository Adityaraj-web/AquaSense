## 🚀 About AquaSense
Water is life — but unsafe water threatens millions. **AquaSense** is a complete **hardware + software solution** for monitoring and analyzing water quality in real-time.  

- ✅ **Self-built low-cost sensors** (pH, Electrical Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, Turbidity, TDS)  
- ☁️ **Cloud integration with Consentium** – live readings streamed securely  
- 📊 **Web dashboard** – intuitive charts, status indicators, and color-coded alerts  
- 🤖 **Smart analysis** – overall water quality classification with tailored recommendations  

Our goal: make water quality analysis **affordable, scalable, and accessible** for communities, farmers, and industries.

## ✨ Features
- **5 Key Parameters Monitored**
  - pH
  - Electrical Conductivity (EC)
  - Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
  - Turbidity
  - Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

- **Modern Dashboard**
  - Real-time graphs (auto-refreshing)
  - Alerts with traffic-light system (Green = Good, Yellow = Moderate, Red = Poor)
  - Historical logs for trend analysis
  - One-click **“What does this mean?”** explanations

- **Smart Recommendations**
  - Suggestions for drinking, agricultural, industrial, or groundwater use
  - Easy interpretation for non-experts

- **Hackathon-ready stack**
  - Hardware sensors built from scratch
  - Web app powered by **Next.js + TailwindCSS**
  - Cloud pipeline with **Consentium** for data ingestion

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Sensors** measure raw data (pH, EC, DO, Turbidity, TDS).  
2. **ESP32 + Consentium Cloud** streams live readings.  
3. **AquaSense Web App** receives data via API.  
4. **Analysis Engine** evaluates quality → *Good / Moderate / Poor*.  
5. **Dashboard** shows charts, logs, and actionable recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Custom-built sensors (pH, EC, DO, Turbidity, TDS), ESP32  
- **Cloud**: Consentium IoT platform  
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TailwindCSS, Recharts  
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes 
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 🏆 Why AquaSense Stands Out
- End-to-end solution: hardware + cloud + web app  
- Self-designed low-cost sensors (not off-the-shelf!)  
- Real-time, actionable insights instead of raw numbers  
- Elegant, modern, and intuitive dashboard
